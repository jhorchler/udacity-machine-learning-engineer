# Project: Predict Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best
real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to
leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with
finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, youâ€™ve come across the
Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for
houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for
each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a
statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to
estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.

## Project Highlights

This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many techniques for
training, testing, evaluating, and optimizing models, available in sklearn.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

- How to explore data and observe features.
- How to train and test models.
- How to identify potential problems, such as errors due to bias or variance.
- How to apply techniques to improve the model, such as cross-validation and
  grid search.

## Starting the Project

For this assignment, you can find the boston_housing folder containing the
necessary project files on the
[<https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning](Machine> Learning projects GitHub),
under the projects folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll
use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that
you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!

This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing
  your work on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the
  project. Do not modify.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project
files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb` to open
up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can
use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the
notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the
notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the
project. A **README** file has also been provided with the project files which
may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.

### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each
datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston
Housing dataset found on the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

#### Features

1. `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

#### Target Variable

1. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

## Submitting the Project

### Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the Predicting
Boston Housing Prices project rubric. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly
and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the
rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.

### Submission Files

Following files would be needed for evaluation:

- The `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all
  code cells executed and displaying output.
- An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This
  file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.

When you are ready to submit your project, There are three ways in which your#
project can be submitted for evaluation.

1. If you ran the notebook from your **local machine** collect the above files
   and compress them into a single archive for upload.
2. You could supply the above files on your **GitHub Repo** in a folder named
   `boston_housing` for ease of access. This would build a good Github profile
   in parallel.
3. If you worked using the **workspace inside the classroom** you can submit
   your project directly for review using the submit button at the end of
   project, just make sure you download the HTML report to local machine and
   upload it back into workspace before submitting your report.
