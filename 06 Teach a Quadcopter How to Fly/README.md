# Train a Quadcopter How to Fly

Design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice!

Try to apply the techniques you have learnt, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.

## Instructions

Take a look at the files in the directory to better understand the structure of the project.

- task.py: Define your task (environment) in this file.
- agents/: Folder containing reinforcement learning agents.
  - policy_search.py: A sample agent has been provided here.
  - agent.py: Develop your agent here.
- physics_sim.py: This file contains the simulator for the quadcopter. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.

For this project, you will define your own task in task.py. Although we have provided a example task to get you started, you are encouraged to change it. Later in this notebook, you will learn more about how to amend this file.

You will also design a reinforcement learning agent in agent.py to complete your chosen task.

You are welcome to create any additional files to help you to organize your code. For instance, you may find it useful to define a model.py file defining any needed neural network architectures.
